latexmk.py
==========

Overview
--------

Latexmk.py completely automates the process of generating
a LaTeX document. Given the source files for a document,
latexmk.py issues the appropriate sequence of commands to
generate a .dvi or .pdf version of the document.
It is specialized to run as a custom builder for the
Eclipse-Plugin "Texlipse".
